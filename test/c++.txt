1.<iomanip>

This library provides manipulators for stream formatting, such as controlling the precision, width, and alignment of output.

How it's used:
setprecision: Controls the number of significant digits for floating-point output.
Example in the code:

cout << "Your final grade is " << setprecision(3) 
     << 0.2 * midterm + 0.4 * final + 0.4 * sum / count
     << setprecision(prec) << endl;

2.<ios>

This library provides basic I/O functionality and types, including the streamsize type used for managing precision and stream states.

How it's used:
streamsize: Represents the precision value of the output stream.


streamsize prec = cout.precision();

Loop Invariant Overview:

An invariant must hold:
Before the loop starts.
At the start of each iteration.
After the loop ends.


A vector is a type in c++ that can hold any amount of a given type and it grows as more is being added

vector<double> homework;
// invariant: homework contains all the homework grades read so far
while (cin >> x)
homework.push_back(x);
